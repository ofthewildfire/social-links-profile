## My process

I began with the HTML and then I completed the CSS, due to the simplicity of this challenge, I was able to just create this within the CSS from a desktop perspective and then make small changes to the view for mobile view. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
